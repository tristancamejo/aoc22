# Advent of Code: 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

## My workflow

I'm using [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) this year and I'm solving these challenges like so:

- Make a new directory for the day
- Create a README.md file with the challenge description'
- Open the README in vscode's markdown preview

- Create a new file called `p1.cr`
- Write the solution
- Test it with `crystal run p1.cr`
- If it works, move on to part 2
